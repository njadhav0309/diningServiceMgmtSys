# diningServiceMgmtSys

Dining Services are majorly found across US Universities which provides opportunities for students to work in the field and get an exposure to the local culture and improve their soft skills. Dining services let the student learn and earn at the same time by working on campus where they are protected by several federal laws from exploitation. 

Dining Service Management System was developed by me for smooth running and management of dining services at university campus. This project provides a clear explanation and view on how efficiently dining services can operate. This project is a distinct analysis of my own dining system which defines the problem of the current manual system they are operating through.
 
After closely analysing the system, I came out with few constraints and datasets to develop a system which can readily show the implementation and maintenance of the system effectively.
 
As a result, I devised a system to maintain DBMS records in a systematic and error free manner. My model will offer the management to help and secure data for storage and backup systems and also ensures the smooth transaction of the workflow throughout the system. My plan of focus is to ensure that the database holds all the information
 
This design is to ensure the maximum efficiency of the Dining Service Management System and to seal unnecessary possible loopholes in the system and indeed will help the dining services administration and staff members to steer the dining services functionality and transactions to realize the maximum potential to add competence in the student hospitality field.
